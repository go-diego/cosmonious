                        At the moment, Oxomo is an unofficial side-project. It
                        serves to experiment with API and data scraping from
                        these different space news sources as a way to showcase
                        my skills as a front-end engineer.

                        Oxomoco, or Oxomo for short, is the Aztec goddess of
                        night, who, along with her husband Cipactonal, is in
                        charge of the Aztec calendar. So, sheâ€™s the perfect
                        figure for a web app that collects daily space news from
                        across the web seamlessly in one place.
